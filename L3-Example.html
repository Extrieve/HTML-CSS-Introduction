    <P>
Consider this example of HTML:

<PRE>
    &lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;DFN&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt; HTML tags.&lt;/DFN&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The word <i>overlapping</i> is contained within both the <SAMP>&lt;B&gt;</SAMP>
and <SAMP>&lt;DFN&gt;</SAMP> tags. A browser might be confused by this
coding and might not display it the way you intend. The only way to know is to
check each popular browser (which is time-consuming and impractical).
<p>
In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing them up.
Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tags
may be omitted, such as paragraphs)
should be paired without an intervening tag in between. Look again at the
example above. You cannot pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (the
first definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you
have any problem areas that should be fixed before your release your
files to a server.</p>
